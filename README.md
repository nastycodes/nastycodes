# Hey there 👋 <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nastycodes&style=flat-square&color=blue">

I'm a 23 year old full-stack developer based in germany. At 12 years old i started coding, which turned out to be my job.

I am working a full time job so do not expect me to regularly update my stuff. As soon as there is time, there will be an update.

I do a plenty of things like websites, applications, plugins for content management systems, data structuring and apis with languages like php, sql, javascript, c++, c#, vb.net and work with all sorts of frameworks for each of them.

Mainly i am working on a website cms, besides that on a variety of open source cms plugins and some other stuff. 

If youre interested in the cms, i am always open for new contributors. As soon as there is a stable version a repository will be created.
Until then you can message me on discord.

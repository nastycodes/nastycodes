# Hey there 👋 <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nastycodes&style=flat-square&color=blue">

I'm a 23 year old full-stack developer based in germany. At 12 years old i started coding, which turned out to be my job (gratuated July 2022).
Before i started my official education i gathered knowledge in my spare time and developed some very shitty stuff i am not proud of. (hence why you won't find it here)
I do a plenty of things with languages like c++, c#, vb.net, php, javascript and work with all sorts of frameworks for each of them.

Mainly i am working on a website cms, besides that on a variety of open source cms plugins and some other stuff. 

If youre interested in the cms, i am always open for new contributors. As soon as there is a stable version a repository will be created.
Until then you can message me on discord.
